# Flexible Content Extended for Advanced Custom Fields

> Extends the ACF Flexible Content Field by transforming the layout list into a modal with image previews. Editing the fields layouts also happens in a modal for a better editing user experience.

## Editing Layouts

The button to collapse the layouts are changed to an edit button (pencil icon). When you click the edit button or double click the layout, the layout's field will be opened in a modal window.

## Image Previews

### Image Conventions

* The size of the image should be 732 x 300.
* They should be named based on the layout's name (`text_block`) with underscores converted to dashes (`text-block.jpg`).

### Image Location

Images should be placed in your theme. By default, images are located here: `THEME/lib/admin/images/acf-flexible-content-extended`.

Also note that you can filter this path, but it **MUST** be in your theme:

```php
add_filter( 'acf-flexible-content-extended.images_path', $path );
```

**NOTE:** The path should not have a trailing beginning or trailing slash!

You can filter the file extension the plugin searches for. By default the plugin expects `jpg`.

```php
add_filter( 'acf-flexible-content-extended.images_extension', $extension );
```

**NOTE:** The extension should not have a leading dot!

Additionally, you could filter all keys and/or images:

```php
add_filter( 'acf-flexible-content-extended.images', $images );
```
