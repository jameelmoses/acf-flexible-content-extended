Extends the ACF Flexible Content Field by transforming the layout list into a modal with image previews and editing in a modal for better UX.

== Description ==
Extends the ACF Flexible Content Field by transforming the layout list into a modal with image previews. Editing the fields layouts also happens in a modal for a better editing user experience.

= Image Conventions =

* The size of the image should be 730 x 300.
* They should be named based on the layout\'s name (`text_block`) with underscores converted to dashes (`text-block.jpg`).

= Image Location =

Images should be placed in your theme. By default, images are located here: `THEME/lib/admin/images/acf-flexible-content-extended`.

Also note that you can filter this path, but it **MUST** be in your theme:

`add_filter( \'acf-flexible-content-extended.images_path\', $path );`

**NOTE:** The path should not have a trailing beginning or trailing slash!

You can filter the file extension the plugin searches for. By default the plugin expects `jpg`.

`add_filter( \'acf-flexible-content-extended.images_extension\', $extension );`

**NOTE:** The extension should not have a leading dot!

Additionally, you could filter all keys and/or images:

`add_filter( \'acf-flexible-content-extended.images\', $images );`
